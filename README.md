## Libraries ðŸ“–
```
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(viridis)
library(shiny)
library(readxl)
rm(list = ls())
```
## Data Prep ðŸ”„
- Read in excel file
- Selected a number of interesting variables with relatively complete data
- Duck and Rock River have too many NA values in the columns I use, so filtered them out
- For the rest, I replaced the NAs with the column mean as it only had a few NAs
```
df <- read_excel("data/master_meta.xlsx") %>% 
  select(Watershed, Site, FBI, pH, Temp, DO_per, DO_ppm, SPC, TDS,
         PO4, NO3, NH3, BOD, TSS, Discharge, Chloride, Arsenic, Mercury, Lead,
                Wetland, Forest, Grass, Agricultural, Imper_Catch) %>%
  filter(!Watershed %in% c("Duck", "Rock River")) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ifelse(is.na(.), mean(., na.rm = TRUE), .)))
```
## EDA ðŸ”Ž

- Quick summary of data and correlation matrix to explore some relationships
```
summary(df)

df_num <- df[, sapply(df, is.numeric)]
cor_matrix <- cor(df_num)
print(cor_matrix)
```

## Analysis and Shiny ðŸ“Š

- Define UI
- Dynamic Shiny where user can choose which plot to display
```
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Mississippi Valley Project"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      selectInput("plotType", "Select Plot Type",
                  choices = c("Arsenic by Site", "Lead by Site",
                              "Scatter Plot with Phosphate and Catchment Levels",
                              "Phosphate by Site"),
                  selected = "Scatter Plot with Phosphate and Catchment Levels"),
      textOutput("text")
    ),
    mainPanel(
      plotOutput("plot", width = '800px', height = '650px')
    )
  )
)
```
- Define server and load data
```
server <- function(input, output) {
    
  selected_plot <- reactive({
    input$plotType
  })
```  
  - Render selected plot
  ```
